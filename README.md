# FreeBSD Community Proposals

This is the repository containing the FreeBSD Community Proposals, see the [index](./index.md).

If you're looking for how to write a FreeBSD Community Proposal you should
start with [FCP 0](./fcp-0000.md) and the
[template](./template.md).

A good place to ask questions is the fcp-editors@freebsd.org list.
